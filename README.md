# vfl-demo
verifiable federated leaning demo

you need to install a terminal multiplexer `tmux` to run this CLI demo, which simulates 3 clients, server, and anvil log in 5 panes in one window
- run `bash start.sh` to start
- run `tmux kill-session` to end (everytime before running it again)

Server: WIP
